# Development Log (Date: 10/28/22 -- 11/04/22)

## Weekly Goals
Our goals for this week are to complete our project proposal and team contract. We also need to create a GitHub repo for our final project and meet in person as a team.

## Specific Tasks Completed (and by who)
We all met together to complete our project proposal and team contract. Pratik created a GitHub repo for all of us and shared it with our team members, our mentor, and instructors.

## Problems Encountered 
We did not encounter any major problems this week. We simply had to brainstorm and fill out our basic documentation for our future work.

## Plans for next week
* Create our project files and initialize classes and test documents

* Go through our dataset and clean up data if needed. 

* Work on setting up MakeFile framework for project

# Development Log (Date: 11/04/22 -- 11/11/22)

## Weekly Goals
Our goals this week were to clean up our dataset

## Specific Tasks Completed (and by who)

Unfortunately we did not get much done this week as we all had many other commitments. However, we all came together to update our proposal and implement the changes our mentor mentioned. Additionally, we better split our work up so we have clearer goals for the upcoming week.

## Problems Encountered 
As we did not get much done, there were not many issues. We plan to address the issue of getting more work done by more clearly detailing our plans.

## Plans for next week
	
Our goals for next week are to work on the project's dataset and create the barebones of the project such as the makefile.  Pratik will work on adapting the Makefile from a previous MP or lab to one that will work for our project. Max and William will write a program to read the dataset into a graph with a Node structure as described in the proposal. Additionally, they will begin work on the BFS graph traversal.

## Optional: Questions for mentor

Is the Landmark Path algorithm sufficient for a 3rd algorithm, or should we pivot to our alternate PageRank algorithm?

## Weekly Goals
Our goals this week were to create a makefile to compile the project code and work on the project's dataset, as well as start work on our BFS algorithm.

## Specific Tasks Completed (and by who)
Pratik created the makefile for the project and added the basic structure. William made the struct to store the data from the dataset. He also started working on BFS for the graph structure.

## Problems Encountered 
There were still some issues with organization as many people had commitments and there was just one group meeting.

## Plans for next week
Our goals for next week are to begin work on our other algorithms and finish BFS. We do plan to work a bit over Thanksgiving break. We plan to get the barebones of all the algorithms done by next week. We also plan to have more group meetings.

## Weekly Goals
Our goals this week were to create the structure for our graph, work on unfinished algorithms such as BFS, and complete as much other work as we could

## Specific Tasks Completed (and by who)
Pratik uploaded the modified makefile for the project. He also wrote a file ingest algorithm to take the .dat file and turn it into an adjacency matrix. William and Max completed the BFS algorithm and Djikstraâ€™s algorithm.

## Problems Encountered 
We were too busy over Thanksgiving break to meet. We hope to correct that this week.

## Plans for next week
Our goals for next week are to write test cases and finish PageRank. Also, we need to work on the presentation video.
