# Team Contract

## Communication
1. **Team Meetings** 
	We plan to meet at least twice a week, but we will schedule additional meetings as needed. Our plan is to meet Monday/Tuesday 3-5 depending on which day works better. Our second weekly meeting time is Thursday during the 3 PM lab section. We plan to meet in person, but will flex meetings to Zoom if one of our team members cannot attend in person. 

2. **Assistance** 
	We will first try to figure it out amongst ourselves using our team group chat, then go to our mentor for help if still not resolved. Office hours will be our last resort. 

3. **Respect** 
	Team members will respect each other. No one will put anyone else down, or make them feel bad about themselves. Team members will also listen to each others' concerns 

## Collaboration

4. **Work Distribution** 
	Our plan is to distribute work at each of our team meetings. We will come up with specific tasks to be completed and then evenly distribute them among team members. If any team member feels they are having trouble completing their task, we will meet and discuss how we can make the team member feel more comfortable with their workload.

5. **Time Commitment**  
	To avoid conflict, team members are expected to respond in a timely manner to texts and should have clear knowledge of what their expected tasks and roles are. If there is a conflict, we plan to solve it by majority vote. If we are deadlocked, we will take our issue to our team mentor for advice. If still unresolved, we will use a game of chance to resolve the issue.

6. **Conflict Resolution** 
	To avoid conflict, team members are expected to respond in a timely manner to texts and should have clear knowledge of what their expected tasks and roles are.
